# Migrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK

To migrate your app from UWP to the Windows App SDK, the UI code likely needs just a few namespace changes while much of the platform code can stay the same.

> [!NOTE]
> There's no need to migrate your project if the functionality currently supported by the [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](/windows/uwp/) is sufficient as [WinUI 2](../../winui/winui2/index.md), and the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/), support UWP project types.

Even though you might need to adjust some code due to differences between desktop apps and UWP apps, migrating most apps requires just a few steps.

1. [Create your first WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK) project packaged desktop project](../../winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app.md) (this could go into your app's existing solution).
2. Copy your XAML/UI code. In many cases you can simply change namespaces (for example, **Windows.UI.\*** to **Microsoft.UI.\***).
3. Copy your app logic code. Some APIs need tweaks, such as **Popup**, **Picker**s, and **SecondaryTile**s.

Take particular note of [What's supported when migrating from UWP to WinUI 3](what-is-supported.md), which describes any functionality that's not yet supported in WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK. If your app needs any of those features/libraries, you might want to consider postponing migration.

> [!NOTE]
> If your UWP source code is written in C++/CX, you will need to port that code (see [Move to C++/WinRT from C++/CX](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/move-to-winrt-from-cx)).

## Migrating by using the .NET Upgrade Assistant tool

As a further step in assisting you to migrate your UWP apps to the Windows App SDK and WinUI 3, we've leveraged the .NET Upgrade Assistant, adding support for migrating C# UWP apps. The UWP support automates much of the migration process. For more info, see the topic [Migrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK with the .NET Upgrade Assistant](upgrade-assistant.md).
