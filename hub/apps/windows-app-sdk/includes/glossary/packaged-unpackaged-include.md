* **MSIX-packaging**. This is the process of packaging an app using MSIX technology (see [What is MSIX?](/windows/msix/overview)). MSIX is a package format that gives your users an easy way to install, uninstall, and update your app using a modern UI. MSIX-packaging also gives your app a *package identity*, which is needed for certain Windows features (for example, custom context menu extensions).
* **Sparse-packaging**. This is a way to opt out of MSIX-packaging, so that your app is unrestricted in terms of the kind of app it is, the APIs it can call, and its access to the Registry and file system. And with sparse-packaging, your app still has package identity, so you can use the Windows features mentioned above. An app that's sparse-packaged is typically installed and updated using `.exe` or `.msi` files; and uses a custom installer, ClickOnce, or xcopy deployment.
* **No packaging**. Another way to opt out of MSIX-packaging, for the reasons given above. But an app that isn't packaged doesn't have package identity. An app that's not packaged is typically installed and updated using `.exe` or `.msi` files; and uses a custom installer, ClickOnce, or xcopy deployment.
