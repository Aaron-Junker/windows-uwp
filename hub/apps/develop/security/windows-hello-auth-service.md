# Create a Windows Hello login service

This is the second part of a complete walkthrough on how to use Windows Hello as an alternative to traditional username and password authentication systems in packaged Windows apps. This article picks up where Part 1, [Windows Hello login app](windows-hello-login.md), left off and extends the functionality to demonstrate how you can integrate Windows Hello into your existing application.

In order to build this project, you'll need some experience with C#, and XAML. You'll also need to be using Visual Studio 2022 on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine. See [Get started with WinUI](/windows/apps/get-started/start-here) for complete instructions on setting up your development environment.
